# Project Marine Heat Waves 

Template repository for hosting the output of your internship. It should provide all the material needed to reproduce your analysis. This is what you will deliver at the end of the internship. 

This README.md will serve as an entry point for explaining the purpose of the intership and the organization of the material stored in the repository. 

## Scientific Context 

With the global warming, all the components of the climatic system experienced an increase in temperature over the last decades. This is also true for the different bodies of water, and for example the mediterranean sea. Along this warming, there has been an increase in extreme events, such as Marine Heat Waves (MHW) which are defined as when the sea temperature exceeds a threshold relative to the climatology. With this increase in MHW, it is more and more important to understand these extreme phenomena and what causes them. 

To do so we will use a probabilistic simulation with an Ensemble of 30 simulations. This will allow us to determine which part of what causes the MHWs is due to oceanic variability, and which is due to atmospheric forcing. This is possible because all of our simulations follow the same atmospheric forcing and the differences between them are caused by the oceanic variability.
